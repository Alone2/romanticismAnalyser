# Instructions
Copy every chapter of frankenstein as a file in the folder "frankenstein".
* We use the naming convention of the 1818 version of the book.
* The first four letters must include the word "Letter" in their filename.
* All chapters must include the word "Chapter" in their filename.
* The file of the last part, "Walton, in continuation", must include the word "Walton" in it's filename.
* The programm will go throught the chapters in alphabetical order, so it's best to name them "Letter1.txt" "Letter2.txt" etc. , as the programm expects the second Letter in alphabetical order to be the second letter in the book
* A filename should not contain more than one of these three words: "Letter" "Chapter" "Walton"
